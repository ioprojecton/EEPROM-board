I2C EEPROM memory expansion board

EEPROM board is designed for usage with various development systems and other MCU device with I2C protocol. EEPROM accessory board is designed to add 4 x 24LCxx family of EEPROM memory to a microcontroller via serial I2C communication.

EEPROM Board is the perfect solution for adding or increasing the available EEPROM storage area for your system. This board adds four 24Lxx EEPROM's to a standard I2C bus. 

Data is transferred serially using this protocol. Data is stored permanently in these devices, even with the power disconnected. 

Key features:
•DIP sockets for easy installation of EEPROM memory chips.
•Predefined and printed on board addresses for sockets.
•400Khz speed guaranteed (look datasheet for speed of your EEPROM chip).
•Only 2 data lines are required for control and storage using the standard I2C bus arrangement.
•Decoupling capacitors are also included onboard for each IC.
